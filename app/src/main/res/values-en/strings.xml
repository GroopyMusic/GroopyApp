    <string name="faq_question1">Do I have to be connected to the Internet to use the app ?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer1">No. However, on the day of the event, you will need to sign in to the app, at least once, using an Internet connection like Wi-Fi or 3/4G. To scan tickets, you need to sync your app with our server\'s database on a daily base.</string>
    <string name="faq_question2">Can I use 2 smartphones at the same time to scan tickets ?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer2">Yes, if you are connected to the Internet. If the 2 smartphones are not connected to the Internet, people might successfully have their ticket scanned twice by two different devices.</string>
    <string name="faq_question3">A third person has to use the app during an event, how can he/she have access to it ?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer3">To be able to use the app, you have to be registered to the platform Ticked-it as an event manager. Thus, the person can either use the account of one of the managers of the event or you can temporarily add him/her to your organization.</string>
    <string name="instructions">In order to scan tickets, you need to have your app synced with our database. To do so, you just need to be connected to the internet (Wi-Fi or 3/4G) and to sign in at least once on the day of your event. Be aware that if you sell tickets after this connection, those tickets will not appear on the app. Therefore, you\â€™ll need to sign in once again (with an Internet connection).</string>
    <string name="no_internet">No connection ?!</string>
